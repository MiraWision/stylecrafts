## Color Inspector: Advanced Color Analysis and Harmony Tool

The **Color Inspector** is a powerful tool for exploring and analyzing colors in digital design. Instantly view any color’s HEX, RGB, and HSL values, and get detailed insights into its temperature, luminosity, and saturation. The tool automatically generates harmonious color schemes—including complementary, triadic, tetradic, analogous, split-complementary, and square—visualized on an interactive color wheel.

You can quickly see matching shades, experiment with color harmonies, and build accessible, visually balanced palettes for your projects. The Color Inspector is ideal for designers, developers, and anyone who wants to understand how colors interact and create beautiful, functional color combinations for branding, UI, illustration, and web design.

## Convert Base64 to Image

Decoding Base64 strings back to images is a common requirement when dealing with embedded or transmitted image data. This process converts the Base64 encoded data back into a binary image file, allowing you to display or manipulate the image as needed.

### Understanding Base64 Decoding

Base64 decoding reverses the encoding process, converting the ASCII string back into its original binary format. This is useful when you receive image data as a Base64 string, for example, through APIs or as part of a data payload, and you need to render the image on a web page or use it in an application.

### Practical Use Cases

Base64 to image conversion is often used in scenarios where images are stored or transmitted in Base64 format but need to be displayed or processed as regular image files. For instance, if you receive image data from a database or a web service in Base64 format, you can decode it to retrieve and use the image in its original form.

### How to Convert Base64 to Image

Using a decoding tool or code snippet, you can easily convert Base64 strings back into image files. This process typically involves parsing the Base64 string, decoding it into binary data, and then saving or displaying the resulting image. This capability is essential for applications that need to handle images dynamically or retrieve them from encoded sources.

By converting Base64 strings to images, you can effectively manage and utilize image data received in this encoded format, enhancing your application's flexibility and functionality.

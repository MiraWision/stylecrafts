## Color Contrast Checker

Color contrast is a fundamental aspect of accessible design that ensures text and interactive elements are readable for all users, including those with visual impairments. Our contrast checker tool helps you verify that your color combinations meet accessibility standards and provide optimal readability across different devices and lighting conditions.

### Why Color Contrast Matters

Proper color contrast is essential for several reasons:

* **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensures your designs meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards for inclusive design
* **Readability**: Improves text legibility for all users, especially in challenging lighting conditions
* **User Experience**: Creates designs that are comfortable to read and navigate for extended periods
* **Legal Requirements**: Helps meet accessibility requirements in various jurisdictions and industries
* **Professional Standards**: Demonstrates commitment to inclusive design principles

### Understanding Contrast Ratios

Contrast ratio measures the difference in luminance between two colors, typically expressed as a ratio. Higher ratios indicate better contrast:

* **Normal Text (≤18pt or ≤14pt bold)**:
  - **4.5:1**: Minimum contrast for WCAG AA compliance
  - **7:1**: Enhanced contrast for WCAG AAA compliance
* **Large Text (≥18pt or ≥14pt bold)**:
  - **3:1**: Minimum contrast for WCAG AA compliance
  - **4.5:1**: Enhanced contrast for WCAG AAA compliance
* **UI Components and Graphics**: **3:1** minimum contrast for accessibility

### Applications in Design

Color contrast checking is crucial across various design disciplines:

* **Web Design**: Ensuring text readability on websites and applications
* **UI/UX Design**: Creating accessible user interfaces and user experiences
* **Print Design**: Maintaining readability in printed materials
* **Brand Design**: Ensuring brand colors work well together in different contexts
* **Mobile Design**: Optimizing contrast for various screen types and lighting conditions

Our contrast checker provides real-time feedback on your color combinations, helping you make informed decisions about your design choices and ensure accessibility compliance.

## Introduction
Accessibility is not just a compliance checkbox — it's a way to make sure your work reaches *everyone*. With more than 2.2 billion people worldwide experiencing vision impairments, accessibility should be considered a cornerstone of digital design.

## The Role of Color Contrast
Color plays a huge role in accessibility. Poor contrast between text and background can make content unreadable for users with low vision or color blindness.  

The **WCAG guidelines** suggest minimum contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text). Meeting these levels ensures better readability for all users.

## Practical Accessibility Techniques
Improving accessibility goes beyond colors:  
- Use **alternative indicators** like icons, patterns, or underlines in addition to color.  
- Provide **descriptive labels and alt text** for images.  
- Stick to **clear typography** and adequate font sizes.

## Beyond Colors: Holistic Accessibility
Colors are important, but accessibility is about the *whole experience*. Semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and clear navigation all contribute to inclusivity.  

## Conclusion
Designing with accessibility in mind is not a limitation — it's an opportunity. By making your work inclusive, you're expanding your audience and creating a better user experience for everyone.

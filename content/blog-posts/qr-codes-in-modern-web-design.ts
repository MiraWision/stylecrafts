## Introduction
Once seen mostly on packaging and posters, QR codes have now become an essential part of modern web and product design. From restaurant menus to ticketing systems, QR codes create a direct bridge between the physical and digital worlds. For web designers, they represent not only a functional tool but also an opportunity to innovate in user experience.

## QR Codes in Everyday UX
Think about the last time you scanned a QR code — maybe at a café to see the menu, or on a concert ticket for entry. QR codes have become a seamless part of our everyday flow: **scan → open → engage**.  

For designers, this means integrating QR codes isn't just a technical choice; it's part of shaping how users interact with your brand.

## QR Codes in Modern Web Design
QR codes are now common across landing pages, e-commerce checkout flows, and personal portfolios. Designers are experimenting with:  
- **Stylized codes** that reflect a brand's identity.  
- **Placement on print + digital materials** for cross-channel campaigns.  
- **Interactive call-to-action designs** where the QR code feels like part of the UI.

## Best Practices for Designers
To ensure QR codes are not only stylish but also functional:  
- Keep **high contrast** so scanners can read them.  
- Use **short links** (e.g., via URL shorteners) to reduce data size.  
- Place codes where users naturally look, but not where they'll be cropped or folded (on brochures or packaging).  

## Conclusion
QR codes are more than just black-and-white squares; they're a design element that blends physical and digital experiences. With the right styling and placement, they can become part of your visual identity.

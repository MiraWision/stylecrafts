## 1. The Basics of Color Theory
Color theory is a framework that designers use to understand how colors interact and how they can be combined to create aesthetically pleasing designs. The fundamental elements include the color wheel, color harmonies, and color contexts.

- **Primary Colors**: Red, blue, and yellow – these colors cannot be created by mixing other colors.
- **Secondary Colors**: Green, orange, and purple – these are formed by mixing primary colors.
- **Tertiary Colors**: Colors created by mixing primary and secondary colors, like red-orange or blue-green.

## 2. Applying Color Harmonies in Digital Design
Color harmonies are combinations of colors that are pleasing to the eye. They are used to create a balanced and harmonious design. Some popular harmonies include:

- **Complementary Colors**: Opposite each other on the color wheel (e.g., blue and orange). They provide high contrast and vibrant look.
- **Analogous Colors**: Next to each other on the wheel (e.g., blue, blue-green, and green). They create a serene and comfortable design.
- **Triadic Colors**: Equally spaced around the wheel (e.g., red, yellow, blue). These offer high contrast while retaining balance and richness.

## 3. Understanding Color Context and Interaction
How colors appear can change based on their context and the colors around them. Understanding this interaction is crucial for making design decisions that are both functional and visually appealing.

- **Simultaneous Contrast**: How two colors affect each other when placed side by side. For example, a grey color will look lighter next to black and darker next to white.
- **Vibrating Colors**: High-contrast color combinations that create a vibrating effect. Use these carefully to draw attention but avoid in large amounts as they can be jarring.

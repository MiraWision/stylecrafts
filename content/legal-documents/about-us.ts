# About Us  

MiraWision is a small team with Ukrainian roots, united by a passion for technology and design. We started with open-source libraries and quickly grew into creating tools used by developers and designers around the world.  

Our mission is simple: make creativity and technology easier.  
We believe that great tools should be accessible, intuitive, and spark inspiration — whether you’re coding a new app or designing your next masterpiece.  

## What We Do  
- Build open-source libraries that save time and remove friction  
- Create apps and utilities for designers and developers  
- Share knowledge with the community through guides and experiments  
- Constantly explore new ways to make the web more human and inspiring  

## Our Values  
- **Clarity** — Simple tools, clear design, no clutter  
- **Craft** — Every detail matters  
- **Openness** — Knowledge and code are meant to be shared  
- **Playfulness** — Creativity works best when it’s fun  

If you share our love for building, exploring, and improving the web — welcome to MiraWision.
